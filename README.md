Travelling-salesman-problem (TSP) in C++

What is TSP?

The travelling salesman problem asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?

Essentially this project returns the shortest distance to travel all the points (locations)

How to do?

This project requires us to use the pythagorean theorem to calculate all the distance between the points. 
Moreover we compare all the possible distance so that we get the shortest path. 

There is also a lot of helper functions that can aid you through the project. 
For example there is a function that prints all the points on a small map. This can help you visualise and calculate the distance.
